    <h2>Day <span id="pageIdentify">4</span></h2>
    <div id="greeting"></div>
    <p>Today is day 4. Yesterday I was able to get my navigation set up better, and make the site work better on mobile. However, I didn't get to optimizing the dark mode selector, as I ran out of time with the Javascript elements of the navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, I'm going to start out with working on the dark mode selector, both in it's positioning, and it's aesthetics. I'd like for it to show a sun while in dark mode, and a moon while in light mode, but we'll see how it goes.
    </p>

    <p>I also want to explore the idea of displaying a greeting to new users, and allowing them to set their name as a personalized greeting. I'm guessing I'll need to use localStorage for this, but I'm going to research this tonight.</p>
