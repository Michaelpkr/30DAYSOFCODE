    <h2>Day <span id="pageIdentify">5</span></h2>
    <p id="greeting"></p>
    <p>Today is day 5.  I wasn't able to successfully complete my task of displaying a greeting to new users, so that will be my focus today.<br><br>

        My hope is that I can have the page display a prompt on the user's initial visit, take their name, then greet them on arrival each day, and not display the prompt again for the duration of the 30 days.<br><br>
        ---1 hour 40 minutes left---<br><br>
        I did a push to Github to make sure that the personalization is working in that enviroment, and it looks like we're good to go. In the future, I'd like to have this function in a different way, as the prompt pop up is a little too invasive, and causes the page to not load prior to it asking for the name. <br><br>

        My end state for this would just be a modal that pops up, and blurs the screen around it, after the page loads. I'll need to look into that on a later date.<br><br>

        ---12 minutes left---<br><br>

        I moved onto creating a preferences tab, in which I'd like the user to be able to select site themes (colors, fonts, etc...), but I wanted to display it as a dropdown menu, that runs via Javascript/CSS. This is going to take some more research, mainly in the animations and the show/hide functionality.<br><br>

        I'm running out of time on the preferences tab, so I'll need to push that to tomorrow's session. So that there isn't a dead link on the page, I'm going to hide it in the HTML document itself.
