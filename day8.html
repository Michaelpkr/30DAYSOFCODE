    <h2>Day <span id="pageIdentify">8</span></h2>
    <p id="greeting"></p>
    <p>Today is day 8. Today I'll be using the <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a> and breaking my workflow up into 25 minute sections, so I'll be documenting what I accomplish in each of those sections.</p>
        <h2>Pomodoro 1</h2>
    <p>What I've found is that I want to add more functionality to the site, but because of nature of this site, I don't want to create multiple pages to maintain (30 different versions of multiple pages starts to get out of hand quickly) so I think what I'm doing for the remainder of the thirty days, is adding a text post above, and have tools/games below, laid out in a grid. Today will just be to establish the grid itself, and hopefully dropping in V1 of a PokeDex project I started a long time ago. We'll see how that goes.<br><br>
        <h2>Break 1</h2>
    <p>I'm on my first five minute break after the first Pomodoro, and embarassed to say that a majority of that first 25 minutes was troubleshooting a stylesheet linking issue. I was adjusting styles7.css, while working on my day8.html, and I thought I was losing my mind. Everything is now wired up correctly and I have the applications container built out, and after the break, I'm going to pull old code from my PokeDex application, and see about adding it into this page.</p>
    <h2>Pomodoro 2</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working on adding in my PokeDex application. This shouldn't be too difficult as it's just an API call from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>. I still need to work on styling as my original intent with this tool was just to get comfortable with calling API's and displaying their information to the page itself.</p>
        <h2>Break 2</h2>
    <p>I was able to get my code to display on the page, and it looks to display pretty well on mobile as well. I'd like to use CSS to actually "paint" a Pokedex on screen, but that might be a little too ambitious for the next Pomodoro. I'll at least try and get the order of items in the Pokedex to lay out correctly.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>I stopped with the Pomodoro method tonight. I'm sure it's a good working style in long sessions, but when time is of the essence for these 2 hour blocks, I found it to be more tedious and interuptive than anything.<br><br>
    
    Overall, I'm happy with where I got to tonight. I was able to implement the Pokedex Application into this site, without adding an additional page, and was finally able to start styling it like I had wanted to when I first created it. This will give me the opportunity to further build this out, and add more functionality to it.</p>
