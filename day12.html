        <h2>Day <span id="pageIdentify">12</span></h2>
        <p id="greeting"></p>
        <p>Today is day 12.<br><br>
            If I'm being honest, I'm frustrated.
            <br><br> 
            Most of my time tonight was used researching to figure out a solution to randomizing the Trivia answers, so that the correct answer would not appear first.
            <br><br>
            Part of this 30DAYSOFCODE process, is learning to manage frustration. There are some days that I make really "noticable" progress, and have something to show for my two hours, and then there are days like today, where I don't have as much to show.
            <br><br>
            Something that I'm coming to terms with is that learning development isn't always visual, it's not always noticable. As you scroll through these 30 pages, what you can see is the actual addition and subtraction to the code I'm writing. But what I can't show you is the <em>time</em> spent finding what code to add, what code to adjust, etc...<br><br>
            I can't show you the mental resets that are required for me to Google the same phrase, but slightly adjusted, for the fifth time.<br><br>
            So just know, that even if this page doesn't radically change, day by day, there's the same level of effort that goes into every single day, some just isn't visible.<br><br>
            All of that being said, if you scroll down to the bottom of this page, you can somewhat use the trivia application now, you just still need to reveal the answer to see if you were correct.<br><br>
            I'll be back...tomorrow...
